			<h1>Bubbly & Fun </h1>
		  <p class="grid_12"> <b>1)</b>  First things first, this was kinda hard making okay ?
		  	I shall show you the code tomorrow if I get time. So lets seee ummmm. Oh yeah I wrote the heading on top. So yeah , you always have thi amazing glow around you , which cheers everyone up instantly. People don't realise it maybe fake at times but that never stops you from getting people in the right mood to smile and all. Started with a light one, agay agay dekho kya aata hai.
             
         </p>
        </div> 
         <br>
        <div class="Second">
        	<h1>Amazing</h1>
          <p class="grid_12"> <b> 2)</b> So you must think i ran out of ideas right ? But nooooo, you actually are an amzing human being. I really greatful to meet someone like you and I bet everyone you've met thinks the same. You literally are one of the most amazing people I have seen , like literally if you could touch me and change my life, imagine what all you are capable of. People say this guy is amazing that girl is amazing but yeah , you truly do deserve that title.<b>(</b> Now you'll think zyaada ho gaya , but trust me this is less <b>).</b>
             
        </p>
        </div>
        <br>
      <div class="Third">
       <h1>Couldn't find a title</h1>
       <p class="grid_12"> <b> 3) </b>
       So, lets see. What to write. I actually don't know. But again you're amazing and you have an entire life ahead of you. But there will be things and people holding you back. The trick is to realise......yeah there is no trick. All you need is one good friend I guess ? Anyways, I'll be there with you this entire time I guess , making you laugh being a chutiya not able seriously taken<b>(Fuck my life)</b>. What I want to say is, you can trust me I want to be there for you.
       And also I talk about deflecting topics etc etc, have you noticed my deflecting is kinda similar to yours ?
